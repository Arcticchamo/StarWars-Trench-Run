# StarWars-Trench-Run

===============Specs===============<br>
Engine: Unity 4.5.1

To run, access the build folder and run the .exe file. 

This simple Unity game is an endless top-down shooter where the player is a X-wing making the trench run. Waves of Tie-Fighters will spawn and shoot at the player. The player can collect bombs which destroy all enemies on the screen. The objective is to destroy as many enemies as possible, collecting points for every kill.
The reason for making this game was to focus on optimisation. I wanted the game to be usable on a mobile device, which meant thinking about how the engine/game uses its limited resources. Make sure that "instantiate" is rarely used and object pools are utilised meaning the game can run at a steadier pace.
